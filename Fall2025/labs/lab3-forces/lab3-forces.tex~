\textbf{Topics:}

\setlength{\parskip}{3pt}
\item Familiarity with the force probe
\item Using gravity to cause horizontal cart motion
\item Frictional forces
\item Balance masses with an inclined plane
\end{enumerate}

This lab explores the relationship between forces and motion. It uses many of the same techniques and equipment from previous lectures and labs. In the lab you will measure the
force applied to a small cart while graphically displaying that force
along with the cart's resulting motion.

\clearpage
\textbf{\MakeUppercase{Part 1: Horizontal acceleration}}\\ 
Plug the Force Probe and the Motion Probe into the LabPro logger. Make sure the sensors are properly calibrated. In other words, make sure that you trust the numbers that the probes and computer are telling you. Does the force probe read zero when there is zero force?

Next, using a string and table mounted pulley, set-up the cart, force probe, and bench as illustrated:

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[]{./cart_and_pulley}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


Hanging 300~g produces a gravitational force of 2.94 N.  Check that this is what the force probe reads, keeping in mind that the hanger has a mass of 50~g.  What is the precision of the scale? How accurate is the force probe?  Using the Live Readout values at the bottom of the graph, check the calibration. Add mass to the hanger and check the measured force.  Does changing the orientation of the probe (to vertical, for example) change the measured value of force? Why? You do not need to answer these questions in your lab report, but do keep them in mind when analyzing and plotting the data that you collect.

Now using the cart, pulley, and weights, you will use the motion probe and force probe to explore the relationship between force and acceleration. Collect both motion and force data for the cart as it accelerates away from the motion sensor (use measurements at distances greater than about 50 cm from the motion sensor for the best results).  Using the position-time graph, select the data before you released the cart and ``Strike Through Data Cells'' under the Edit menu.  Similarly mark out the data after the cart reached the end of the track.  Adjust the time axis to zoom in on this subset of the data.  Can you reliably measure the acceleration with the motion sensor?  Try using the slope of the velocity curve to make a better estimate of the
acceleration. Use either the button marked ``M=?'' to find the instantaneous slope of the line or the button marked ``R=?'' to find the mean slope over a time interval. \textbf{Include in your report plots of position, velocity, acceleration, and force vs. time from one experiment. Also include a plot of force vs. acceleration.}  

Next, using different masses on the hanger, measure five different sets of force (mean force) and acceleration (mean acceleration) pairs. Make a plot of your measured force ($y$-axis) vs. acceleration ($x$-axis). 

Here's how to do it in MATLAB:
\begin{verbatim}>> force=[F1 F2 F3 F4 F5]; % enter your force measurements \end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}>> acceleration=[a1 a2 a3 a4 a5]; % enter your acceleration measurements; \end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}>> p=polyfit(acceleration,force,1); \end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}>> plot(acceleration,force,acceleration,p(1)*acceleration+p(2)) \end{verbatim}

The \verb+polyfit+ command used above fits a first-order polynomial (a line) to the data and returns two coefficients. \verb+p(1)+ gives the slope of the line. Note that you always get information about a MATLAB command by typing, e.g., 
\begin{verbatim}>> help polyfit\end{verbatim}

 \textbf{Submit this plot}.  What are the units of the slope?  What does the value of the slope of this plot correspond to physically? What is the y-intercept, and what is its signficance?

\textbf{In addition to submitting the plots from this exercise, type one paragraph describing the motivation and experimental set-up and a couple of paragraphs that (1) describe the graphs, (2) compare observations to theory, and (3) discuss possible sources of error and how the error would affect your results.}

\clearpage
\textbf{\MakeUppercase{Part 2: Friction}}\\
In this part of the lab you will measure the coefficient of friction between a block and the track. Use the same set-up as in Part 1, except replace the cart with one of the friction blocks. You will not need the force probe. You can calculate the coefficient of friction by using Newton's Laws and measuring the mass of the friction block and the acceleration that it experiences.

\textbf{Submit a derivation showing how you can estimate the coefficient of friction from Newton's Laws. Indicate what you measured for the acceleration and mass of the block, and calculate the coefficient of friction.} 

\clearpage
\textbf{\MakeUppercase{Part 3: Inclined plane}}\\
For the second part of the lab, use the inclined plane apparatus.  The inclined plane has a device for measuring angles and a pulley at one end. Add some mass to the cart and measure, using a scale, the total mass of the cart.  Select an angle to tilt the plane.  Draw the free body diagram of the apparatus and \textbf{include the diagram in your report}.

Use Newton's Laws to calculate the mass needed to counter-balance the mass of the cart. \textbf{Show the equations that you used}. Put this mass on the hanger and test your calculation. What happens if you put an ever so slightly heavier or lighter mass on the hanger? Does the cart move? Why or why not? Discuss the results.

If you increase the mass of the cart by 200~g, what is the new mass that you
need on the hanger?  Test this set-up and discuss. You may have to find creative ways to add mass to the cart; one way is to put additional mass on the string just above the cart.

If you double (or halve, whatever is appropriate for your initial
angle) the angle, what is the new value of the mass that you need to balance the cart?  Test this set-up and discuss.
 
\textbf{Write one to two paragraphs describing the experiment and your results.}

%\clearpage
%\textbf{\MakeUppercase{Part 3: Tensional forces and vectors}}\\
%In the last part of the lab you will use a force table and pulleys to explore the tensional force. Set-up the force table and level it as best as you can. Attach three pulleys to the force table at angles of 10$^\circ$, 135$^\circ$. Next, attach three strings and hangars to the small ring. If you place an additional 50 g and 100 g on the first two pulleys (i.e., those at 10$^\circ$ and 135$^\circ$, respectively), where should you place the third pulley and how much mass should you hang over it in order to get the system into static equilibrium?

%Solve this using theoretical arguments, and then test your answer using the force plate. Submit (i) a free body diagram, (ii) your derivation, and (iii) a photo of your system in static equilibrium.
