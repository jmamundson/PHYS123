Name:

\textbf{What you should turn in:} This handout and printed graphs. There should be four derivations (8 pts), one graph (2 pts), calculations and tables with measurements (6 pts), and responses to discussion questions (4 pts).

\textbf{Topics:}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\parskip}{3pt}
\item Torque / torque balance
\item Static equilibrium
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Objective:}\\ 
In this lab you will test the relationships between force, torque, and static equilibrium by performing a series of experiments in which masses are hung from a meter stick. Recall that when a system is in equilibrium,
$$\sum{F_x}=0$$
$$\sum{F_y}=0$$
$$\sum\tau=0$$

%One goal of this lab is to perform the experiments with a high degree of accuracy. Check the validity of your results and repeat the experiment(s) if necessary.

\textbf{\MakeUppercase{Part 1: Equilibrium around center of mass}}\\
Balance a two-meter stick by hanging it near its center.  Place mass $m_1=500\mbox{ g}$ on the 75~cm mark and do not move that mass. Make the stick balance by placing another mass, $m_2$, at a different location. Use five different masses for $m_2$ and for each one find the distance $L$ shown in the figure below.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[]{./centerofmass}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Use MATLAB to make a graph of position ($y$-axis) versus 1/weight ($x$-axis) and use polyfit to find a mathematical relationship between position and weight. Explain your results and compare with what you expected to find. What is the meaning of the slope? What about the y-intercept? Print the graph and turn it in with this handout. {\it Be sure to use proper units and to label the axes.}

Use the space below to find a theoretical relationship between distance and the weight of $m_2$. In other words, set $\sum\tau=0$ and solve for $L$. How does this relationship compare to your graph?


\clearpage
\textbf{\MakeUppercase{Part 2: Mass of the meter stick}}\\
(a) Gravitational forces can be treated as acting at the center of the mass of an object. Using this concept, you will compute the mass of the meter stick by solving a static equilibrium problem. Set up an arrangement of parallel (vertical) forces by hanging the meter stick from any place where it is not balanced (i.e., that string should not pull on the center of mass).  
By placing appropriate masses as shown in the diagram, make the meter stick balance.  What is the mass of the meter stick?

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{./meterstick_mass}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Repeat the experiment with different values of $m_1$, $L_1$, and $L_2$ to confirm the value of the meter stick's mass that you found.
 
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|Y|Y|Y|Y|}
\hline
mass, $m_1$ & $L_1$ & $L_2$ & meter stick mass \\
\hline &&&\\
\hline &&&\\
\hline &&&\\
\hline &&&\\
\hline
\end{tabularx}\\

Use this space to demonstrate how you calculated the mass of the meter stick:

\vspace{5cm}
Now use a scale to measure the mass of a meter stick.

\clearpage
(b) With an unequal arm balance, such as shown in the diagram below, hang
a mass on each side of the meter stick in such a way to make it
balance.  (That is, using a rotation point that is not at the center
of mass of the meter stick, use two masses and find the balance
points.)  Record the masses and distances and compare them to a
calculation of the situation you have created.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics{./meterstick_unequal}

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|Y|Y|Y|Y|Y|}
\hline
$m_1$ & $m_2$ & $L_1$ & $L_2$ & $L_3$\\
\hline &&&&\\
\hline &&&&\\
\hline &&&&\\
\hline
\end{tabularx}\\

One way to compare your measurements to theory is to solve for $L_2$ using $\sum\tau=0$. Show how you do this and compare the theoretical values of $L_2$ to what you measured.
\vspace{6cm}

How much would $L_2$ change if the meter stick was massless?



%(c) This is a more challenging version of (b).  With an unequal arm
%balance, hang equal mass pieces on each side of the meter stick in
%such a way to make it balance.  Record the masses and distances and
%compare them to a calculation of the situation you have created.

\textbf{\MakeUppercase{Part 3: Beams}}\\
Using a meter stick as a beam, set up the device shown below. Decide on (1) a mass to use for $m_2$ and (2) the angle $\theta$, which you'll have to measure. Also measure the distance from the pivot points to the point at which the two strings are tied onto the ruler. Adjust the mass of $m_1$ until the system is in equilibrium.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{./beam}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Experimental value of $m_1$:\\

How does your experimental value compare to theory? How important is it to consider the mass of the ruler?

To find out, sum the torques around the pivot point to find that
\begin{equation}
\sum\tau=m_1g\l_1\sin\theta - m_2gL\cos\theta-\frac{1}{2}m_sgL\cos\theta=0,
\label{tau}
\end{equation}
where $l_1$ is the distances from the pivot point to the the string connecting mass $m_1$, $m_s$ is the mass of the meter stick, and $L$ is the total length of the meter stick. To arrive at equation \ref{tau}, we assumed that the strings are massless and that the pulley is frictionless.

Dividing both sides of equation \ref{tau} by $g$, gathering like terms, and re-arranging gives
\begin{equation}
m_1 = \left(\frac{m_2+\frac{1}{2}m_s}{l_1}\right)L\cot\theta.
\end{equation}
If the ruler were massless,
\begin{equation}
m_1 = \left(\frac{m_2}{l_1}\right)L\cot\theta.
\end{equation}

Calculate $m_1$ both (1) using the measured mass of the meter stick and (2) assuming that the meter stick is massless.
