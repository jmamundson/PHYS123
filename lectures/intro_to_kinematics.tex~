\section{Introduction to kinematics}
Objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Course introduction
\item Key terminology
\item Graphing motion
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Overview}
We'll start the semester by learning about kinematics. Kinematics is the description of motion, and has the same origins as the word cinema. In a few weeks we'll discuss dynamics, or causes of motion. When we combine kinematics with dynamics, we are studying mechanics. In introductory physics, we'll cover classical mechanics --- one of the oldest branches of science.

Classical mechanics: large, slow moving objects\\
Quantum mechanics: small objects\\
General relativity: fast moving objects\\

\subsection{Types of motion}
motion: change in object's position with time

trajectory: path along which an object travels

For now, we'll only worry about rigid body motion (i.e., no deformation).

Four special cases of motion:

\begin{enumerate}
\item straight line
\item projectile motion (influenced by gravity)
\item circular motion (e.g., planets, satellites)
\item rotational motion
\end{enumerate}

For motion that does not involve deformation or rotation, we can use a \textit{particle model}. Models are simplifications of reality that allow us to focus on the important physics. In a particle model, we assume that all of the mass of an object is focused at a single point and that the all parts of the object move in the same direction with the same speed. In class I'll often use particles or boxes to represent much more complicated objects.

\subsection{Terms used to describe motion}
\begin{itemize}
\item position = location of an object

[Insert 1-D diagram; where is the object on this line?]
\vspace{4cm}

position can be positive \textit{or} negative -- this is important\\
units = [L]

\item displacement = change in position, [L] 
$$\Delta{x}=x_f-x_i$$
Can be positive \textit{or} negative (give example).

\item average velocity = average rate of change of position, [L]/[T]
$$v=\frac{\Delta{x}}{\Delta{t}}=\frac{x_f-x_i}{t_f-t_i}$$
Velocity can ALSO be positive \textit{or} negative. What does the sign tell you?

\item average speed = magnitude of average velocity, [L]/[T], always positive


Note that we can go from velocity to displacement by rearranging the equation for velocity: 
$$\Delta x=v_{\rm avg}\Delta{t}$$
which is the same thing as calculating the area under the velocity-time graph.

Average velocity during the first interval:
$$v_1=\frac{x_1-x_0}{t_1-t_0}\Rightarrow\mbox{ slope of a straight line}$$
$$v_1>0$$

Average velocity during the second interval:
$$v_2=\frac{x_2-x_1}{t_2-t_1}<0$$

Often, we are more interested in the instantaneous velocity (i.e., the slope of the line that is tangent to the velocity curve). For those of you that have taken calculus, this is a derivative.

In practice, data is not continuous; velocity calculated from data is an average over some time interval.



\item average acceleration = average rate of change of velocity, [L]/[T$^2$]
$$a_{avg}=\frac{v_2-v_1}{t_2-t_1}=\frac{\Delta{v}}{\Delta{t}}$$
  As with velocity, often we are interested in the instantaneous acceleration, which is the slope of the line that is tangent to the acceleration curve.

Not surprisingly, given what we just saw with displacement, it is easy to go from acceleration to a change in velocity:
$$\Delta{v}=a_{\rm avg}\Delta{t}$$

Acceleration can also be positive \textit{or} negative. What does the sign mean?

Simple rule for determining whether an object is accelerating or decelerating:\\
If $a\cdot v>0$ the object is accelerating, if $a\cdot v<0$ the object is decelerating  
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Example \#1: Going from position to acceleration}
The position of a particle are given in the position-time graph below. Draw the corresponding velocity-time and acceleration-time graphs.
