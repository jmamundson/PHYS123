\subsection*{Damped and driven oscillations}
We've so far only discussed simple harmonic oscillators in the absence of external forces. External forces can cause oscillations to be damped or to grow. In damped oscillations, mechanical energy is converted to thermal energy. In driven oscillations, an external force does work on the system.

\subsubsection*{Damping}
For a pendulum, the main energy loss is due to air resistance, which depends on speed. Let's include this drag force in the force-balance equation. Again, summing the forces in the direction of the pendulum's motion,
$$\sum F=-F_g\sin\theta-F_d=ma_s=m\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}=mL\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}$$
The drag force is proportional to the pendulum's velocity, and therefore
$$F_d=cv=c\frac{ds}{dt}=cL\frac{d\theta}{dt}$$
Using the small-angle approximation,
$$-mg\theta-cL\frac{d\theta}{dt}=mL\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}$$
Again, we arrive at a second-order ordinary differential equation. This one has the solution
$$\theta(t)=\theta_ie^{-\frac{c}{2m}t}\cos\left(\sqrt{\frac{g}{L}-\frac{c^2}{4m^2}}t\right)$$

I admit, this is a mess! But it tells us two things:

(1) The amplitude decays exponentially with time according because of the term $e^{-\frac{c}{2m}t}$. The $e$-folding time, which is the time at which the amplitude is $1/e$ of the original amplitude, is $t=2m/c$. For a metal sphere with a diameter of 0.01~m, $t\approx 400\mbox{ s}$. This is why pendulums can oscillate for a long time. You can increase the $e$-folding time by increasing the mass of the pendulum, so that air resistance has less of an impact on its motion.

(2) The natural frequency of the pendulum is 
$$f=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{g}{L}-\frac{c^2}{4m^2}}$$
Including drag decreases the frequency ever so slightly. For the same metal sphere, $c^2/(4m^2)\approx 1/1600\mbox{ s}^{-2}$. If $L=1\mbox{ m}$, then $g/L\approx 10\mbox{ s}^{-2}$. So the drag has only a very minor effect on the pendulum's frequency.

\subsubsection*{Driven oscillations and resonance}
Oscillating systems have a natural frequency when left alone (as we've already seen). What happens if you subject a system to a periodic, driving frequency?

If the natural frequency matches the natural frequency of the system, you get large oscillations (especially if damping is small) --- this is called resonance.

Example: Cars ride on springs; they therefore have a natural frequency. For a particular car, the natural frequency is 2 Hz. The car is driving 20 mph over a washboard road with bumps every 10 ft. What is the driving frequency? How does it compare to the natural frequency?

$$v=\frac{\Delta{x}}{\Delta{t}}\Rightarrow T=\frac{\Delta{x}}{v}=\frac{10\mbox{ ft}}{20\mbox{ mph}}=0.35\mbox{ s}$$
Which means that
$$f=\frac{1}{T}=2.9\mbox{ Hz}$$

This is just above the natural frequency. Driving faster will reduce the amplitude of the oscillations.





\section{OSCILLATIONS; DRIVEN AND DAMPED OSCILLATIONS}
Last class:
\begin{itemize}
\item Oscillations caused by restoring forces (e.g., stretch a spring, it pulls back)
\item Simple harmonic motion (i.e., sinusoidal oscillations) are caused by \textit{linear} restoring forces
\item Examples of linear restoring forces: masses on springs, bobbing icebergs, and pendulums (for small angles)
\item Derived equations of motion for simple harmonic motion
\end{itemize}


Displacement as a function of time:
$$x(t)=A\cos(2\pi ft)=A\cos\left(2\pi\frac{t}{T}\right)$$ 
Here $A$ is the amplitude of the oscillations.

Velocity is the instantaneous slope of position. Graphically, we saw that this means that
$$v(t)=-v_{max}\sin(2\pi ft)$$

Accleration is the slope of velocity. Graphically, we saw that this means that
$$a(t)=-a_{max}\cos(2\pi ft)$$

\hrulefill\\
For the specific example of an oscillating spring, we 
\begin{enumerate}
\item used conservation of energy to show that 
$$v_{max}=A\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$
and so
$$v(t)=-A\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\sin(2\pi ft),$$
\item used Newton's Second Law to show that
$$a_{max}=A\frac{k}{m}$$
so that
$$a(t)=-A\frac{k}{m}\cos(2\pi ft)$$
\item found a relationship for the frequency by using a result from calculus
$$v_{max}=2\pi fA=A\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\Rightarrow f=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt\frac{k}{m}\Rightarrow T=\frac{1}{f}=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$
\end{enumerate}

\hrulefill\\
Let's talk a little bit about pendulums, and then do some examples. We can describe the displacement of a pendulum either in terms of angle, $\theta$, or distance along the semi-circular path, $s$:
$$\theta(t)=\theta_{max}\cos(2\pi ft)$$
$$s(t)=s_{max}\cos(2\pi ft)=L\theta_{max}\cos(2\pi ft)$$

We saw last class that for small angles, the gravitational restoring force is
$$F_{net}\approx -mg\theta=-\left(\frac{mg}{L}\right) s$$

The restoring force for spring was
$$F_{net}=-kx$$

We've basically just changed the constant of proportionality in the restoring force from $k$ to $mg/L$. It turns out that we can substitute for $k$ to find the frequency of a pendulum.

$$f=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\Rightarrow f=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{mg/L}{m}}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}\Rightarrow T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$

It turns out that, amazingly, the $\sqrt{g}\approx \pi$. This means that a good rule of thumb for the period of a pendulum is
$$T\approx 2\sqrt{L}$$

The frequency only depends on the length of the pendulum, $L$. (Note that this assumes that the mass is all concentrated at the end of the pendulum.)

Pendulums have important implications for physiology. Part of walking involves letting your legs swing like pendulums under the influence of gravity. The more you ``use'' gravity, the less work that your muscles have to do.

So, for example, let's say that my legs are 0.9 m long. The natural period of oscillation (assuming that all of the mass is concentrated at my feet...) is
$$T_o\approx 2\sqrt{0.9}=1.9\mbox{ s}$$

The most efficient speed is for me to take 2 steps in 1.9 s. (Try swinging your legs at $T\neq T_o$; its not efficient!)

If I walk at a leisurely pace, the maximum angle that my legs make from vertical is about 15$^\circ$. Therefore during each step my leg swings through 30$^\circ$, and I travel a distance of $2L\theta_{max}=0.47\mbox{ m}$. One oscillation of the ``pendulum'' is two steps, so this gives a distance of 0.94 m every 1.9 s. This walking speed is 0.49 m/s, or 1.8 km/h. Seems reasonable to me!

Walking speed:
$$v_{walk}\approx \frac{2L\theta_{max}}{2\sqrt{L}}=\sqrt{\theta_{max}L}$$

Note that its difficult to use your legs like pendulums when walking up or down hills. We previously calculated how many Snickers bars it would take to climb up Mt. Juneau. We initially assumed that the body was very efficient --- in other words, we implicitly assumed that we were using our legs like pendulums and letting gravity due a lot of work. Obviously this approximation doesn't work well when you are climbing up steep slopes.

\subsubsection*{Damping}
For a pendulum, the main energy loss is due to air resistance, which depends on speed. If you plot the amplitude vs. time, you'll see that the amplitude decreases exponentially. If you fit a curve through each of the peaks, you'll find
$$x_{max}=A_0e^{-t/\tau}$$
where $A_0$ is the initial amplitude and $\tau$ is a time constant. Damping occurs more quickly for systems with small $\tau$. (Essentially, $\tau$ depends on the form of the drag force.) 

Sometimes you will hear the term $e$-folding time. This refers to the time it takes for the oscillations to decrease to $A_0/e$ (in other words, when $t=\tau$).
